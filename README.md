# Overview

This week I make a flowmodoro timer which tells you how long you've been studying and then gives you a break when you need it. I used typescript which was very usefull to make sure my types were not confused and while I still don't know how I feel about the language I did enjoy using it and I'm happy that I gave it a shot. There still is a lot ot do for this project and want to make some minor improvements to this weeks sprint I am happy how it came out.
